"Question","Answer"
"1. Define SQL?","SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a programming Language designed specially for managing data in Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)."
"2. What is RDBMS? Explain its features?","A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is the most widely used database Management System based on the Relational Database model. Features of RDBMS: 1. Stores data in tables. 2. Tables have rows and columns. 3. Creation and Retrieval of Table is allowed through SQL."
"3. What is Data Mining?","Data Mining is a subcategory of Computer Science which aims at extraction of information from set of data and transform it into Human Readable structure, to be used later."
"4. What is an ERD?","ERD stands for Entity Relationship Diagram. Entity Relationship Diagram is the graphical representation of tables, with the relationship between them."
"5. What is the difference between Primary Key and Unique Key?","Both Primary and Unique Key is implemented for Uniqueness of the column. Primary Key creates a clustered index of column whereas a Unique creates an unclustered index of column. Moreover, Primary Key doesn’t allow NULL value, however Unique Key does allow one NULL value."
