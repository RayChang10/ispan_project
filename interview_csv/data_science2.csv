"Suppose there is a dataset having variables with missing values of more than 30%, how will you deal with such a dataset?","For small datasets, substitute missing values with the mean; for larger datasets, remove rows with missing values."
"What is Cross-Validation?","Cross-Validation is a statistical technique for improving model performance by rotating training and testing with different samples."
"What are the differences between correlation and covariance?","Correlation measures the strength of relationships between variables, while covariance indicates how two variables change together."
