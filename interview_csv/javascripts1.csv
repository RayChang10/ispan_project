"Question","Answer"
"What is the difference between `undefined` and `not defined` in JavaScript?","In JavaScript, using a variable that has not been declared throws an error 'var x is not defined'. Using 'typeof undeclared_variable' returns 'undefined'. If a declared variable has no value, 'console.log(x)' prints 'undefined'."
"What is a 'closure' in JavaScript?","A closure is a function defined inside another function (the parent function) that has access to the parent's scope variables."
"What will be the output of the code below? var trees = ['pine','apple','oak','maple','cherry']; delete trees[3]; console.log(trees.length);","The output will be 5. The 'delete' operator sets the element to 'undefined' but does not affect the array length."
"What is the difference between `==` and `===`?","The `==` operator checks for equality only, while `===` checks for both equality and data type."
"What does the `isNaN()` function do?","The `isNaN()` function returns 'true' if the variable value is not a number."
"What is the result of '10' + 20 + 30 in JavaScript?","The result is '102030' because the '+' operator acts as a string concatenation operator."
"How does `Array()` differ from `[]` while creating a JavaScript array?","Both create arrays, but `Array(n)` creates an uninitialized array of size n, while `[n]` creates an array of size 1 with n as the first element."
"What is the difference between declaring a function in the two formats below? var foo = function() {/* Some code */}; function bar() {/* Some code */};","'foo' is defined at run-time, while 'bar' is defined at parse time."
"What is Scope in JavaScript?","Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions in your code. It can be Global or Local."
"How to call other class methods?","Using 'call()' and 'apply()' methods allows using methods from different contexts. 'call()' takes arguments individually, while 'apply()' takes them as an array."
"Explain the difference between class inheritance and prototypal inheritance.","Class inheritance uses a constructor function with 'new', while prototypal inheritance clones an existing object as a prototype."
"What is prototype property in JavaScript?","The prototype property is used for implementing inheritance, allowing methods and properties to be shared among instances."
"What is the reason for wrapping the entire content of a JavaScript source file in a function block?","It creates a closure that avoids name clashes by making a private namespace."
"Why would you use `use strict` at the beginning of a JavaScript source file?","Using 'use strict' enforces strict parsing and error handling, making debugging easier and preventing accidental globals."
"What is the difference between a method and a function in JavaScript?","A function is not associated with any object, while a method is defined inside an object and operates on its data."
"What is JavaScript self-invoking anonymous function?","A self-invoking anonymous function runs immediately upon definition and does not have a name."
"What will the code below output? var a = [1, 2, 3]; a[10] = 99; console.log(a[6]);","The output will be 'undefined' because slots 3 to 9 are empty."
"What will be the output of the following code? var Employee = {company: 'Acme'}; var employee1 = Object.create(Employee); delete employee1.company; console.log(employee1.company);","The output will be 'Acme' because 'company' is a prototype property and cannot be deleted."
"What will be the output of the following code? var z = 1, y = z = typeof y; console.log(y);","The output will be 'undefined' because 'typeof y' executes first and returns 'undefined'."
"Consider the two functions below. Will they both return the same thing? function foo1(){return {bar: 'hello'};} function foo2(){return{bar: 'hello'};}","No, 'foo2' will return 'undefined' due to missed semicolon insertion by JavaScript."
"What are the differences between `null` and `undefined`?","JavaScript has two distinct values for nothing: null and undefined. `undefined` means the value of the variable is not defined, while `null` indicates an empty or non-existent value."
"What are the differences between `==` and `===`?","The `==` operator checks for equality without considering type, while `===` checks for both value and type equality."
"How would you compare two objects in JavaScript?","You can compare two objects by checking if they have the same number of properties and if each property has the same value. Use Object.getOwnPropertyNames to get the keys."
"11+ true false related questions that will trick you.","In JavaScript, falsy values include false, null, undefined, '', 0, and NaN. Truthy values include true and everything else that is not falsy."
"As `[]` is true, `[]==true` should also be true. right?","`[]` is truthy, but `[]==true` is false due to implicit type coercion; it compares `0` to `1`."
"How could you write a method on instance of a date which will give you next day?","You can extend the Date prototype: Date.prototype.nextDay = function() { return new Date(this.setDate(this.getDate() + 1)); }."
"If I have a `var str = 'hello world'`, how could I get `str.reverse()` return 'dlrow olleh'?","Extend the String prototype: String.prototype.reverse = function() { return this.split('').reverse().join(''); }."
"How could you make this work [1,2,3,4,5].duplicator(); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]?","Add a method in the Array prototype: Array.prototype.duplicator = function() { return this.concat(this); }."
"If you want to use an arbitrary object as value of this, how will you do that?","You can use bind, call, or apply methods to set the value of `this` in a function."
"If an older browser doesn't have bind function, how will you shim it?","Function.prototype.bind = Function.prototype.bind || function(context) { var self = this; return function() { return self.apply(context, arguments); }; }."
"Write a simple function to tell whether 2 is passed as parameter or not?","function isTwoPassed() { var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments); return args.indexOf(2) != -1; }."
"How could you use Math.max to find the max value in an array?","Use Math.max.apply(null, arr) to find the max value in an array."
"What the heck is this in JavaScript?","`this` refers to the current execution context and varies based on how the function is called."
"Look at the code below, you have a for loop if you have setTimeout inside it. If log the loop counter inside setTimeout, what will be logged?","The loop counter will show the final value due to closure; it captures the variable reference."
"Look at the code below, I have a property in a object and I am creating a new object where I am setting it to a new value. If I delete that property what will I get if I try to access that property?","You will get `undefined` if you delete the property."
"Does JavaScript pass parameter by value or by reference?","JavaScript passes primitive types by value and objects by reference."
"How could you implement cache to save calculation time for a recursive fibonacci function?","You can use memoization to cache results of previous calculations."
"How could you cache execution of any function?","You can create a wrapper function that stores results of previous calls based on arguments."

"How could you implement moveLeft animation?","You can use CSS transitions or JavaScript to change the position of an element."
"How would you implement currying for any functions?","You can create a function that returns another function, capturing parameters until all are provided."
