題目,答案
"How to find the middle element of the linked list in one pass?","Maintain two pointers: one increments at each node, the other increments every two nodes. When the first pointer reaches the end, the second points to the middle."
"How to find if a linked list has a loop?","Use two pointers: one moves one step and the other moves two steps. If they meet, there is a loop."
"How to find the third element from the end in a linked list in one pass?","Use two pointers; when the first moves to the 3rd element, the second points to the 3rd from the end when the first reaches the end."
"In an integer array, there is 1 to 100 number, out of one is duplicate, how to find?","Calculate the expected sum (n(n+1)/2) and subtract the actual sum from it to find the duplicate number."
"How to reverse String in Java?","Use a loop or recursion to reverse the string without using the reverse() method of StringBuffer."
"Write a Java program to sort an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm?","Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an integer array."
"What is the difference between Stack and Queue data structure?","Stack is LIFO (Last In First Out) while Queue is FIFO (First In First Out)."
"How do you find duplicates in an array if there is more than one duplicate?","Use a HashMap to count occurrences of each number and identify duplicates."
"What is the difference between the Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List data structure?","A Singly Linked List has nodes pointing to the next node only, while a Doubly Linked List has nodes pointing to both the next and previous nodes."
"How to implement a stack using an array?","Use an array to store elements and manage the top index to push and pop elements."
"How to implement a queue using a linked list?","Use a linked list to maintain the front and rear pointers for enqueue and dequeue operations."
"What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array?","The time complexity is O(1) because arrays allow direct access via indices."
"What is the time complexity of searching an element in a linked list?","The time complexity is O(n) as it requires traversal of the list."
"What is a binary tree?","A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child."
"What is a hash table?","A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots."
